# terratest
terratest is a simple unittesting library for use in the [terra programming language](https://github.com/terralang/terra). It is written as a language extension of terra and provides several keywords: `test`, `testenv`, `testset`, and `terracode`. `test` signals a boolean lua/terra expression, `testenv` provides a safe environment for writing tests, which may be organized in `testset`'s. Finally, `terracode` represents a block of terra code.

The design is kept simple and allows for
* Inline testing, directly in your code
* Scoped evaluation of tests inside code blocks `testset` and `testenv`
* Tests and testsets inside `testenv` are only run if the command-line-option `--test` or `-t` is passed to terra. Inline tests are always run and print out passed / failed.
* `testset` and `testenv` can be parameterized by lua code

The keyword `test` always expects a boolean result.

## Installation and use
Simply copy paste the file `terratest` into your folder and use the library by means of the statement
```
import "terratest"
```
## Writing and evaluating tests
Tests may combine both lua and terra code. For example, the following code directly evaluates a lua statement
```
local a = 1
local b = 2
test a+1==b
```
and the following snippet involves a terra function
```
terra foo(a : int)
  return a+1
end
test f(1)==2
test f(2)==4
```
If a test fails then the linenumber and filename of the test statement is printed for convenience. For example, the above code returns
```
  test passed
  test passed
  test failed in test.t, linenumber 11
```
`test` always expects a boolean result.

### Organizing tests in `testenv`
Although tests can be used directly inline as shown above, it is useful to organize them inside a scoped environment called `testenv`. This environement keeps track of some test statistics, which get printed to stdout. Here is an example
```
import "terratest"           
   
local a = 1  
local b = 3  
   
testenv "my test environement" do
  local c = 10
  terracode   
    var x = 1
    var y = 2
  end
  test a*b==3
  test a*b==4 --false
  test a+b+c==14
  test a+b+c==15 --false
  test a+b+c==x+y+11
end 
```
To evaluate the tests in the testenvironment, you need to run terra with the command-line-option `--test` or `-t`
```
terra test3.t --test
```
which prints out
```
Test Environment: 	my test environement

  inline tests
  3/5 tests passed
  2/5 tests failed

  test failed in test3.t, linenumber 13
  test failed in test3.t, linenumber 15
```
Notice that the test environment is given a name, which gets printed to stdout. Lua variables may be directly declared and terra variables are declared inside a `terracode` block. Notice that terra variables and lua variables may be logically combined and that lexical scoping rules apply.

### Organizing tests using `testset`
`testset` provides another scoped environment that can be used within a `testenv`. A testset is also given a name and test statistics are printed out separately for each testset inside a test environment. For example,
```
import "terratest"

testenv "first test environement" do
  local z = 10
  terracode
    var x = 1 
  end
 
  testset "my first testset" do
    terracode
      var y = 2 
    end 
    test x+y+z==13
  end
 
  testset "my second testset" do
    terracode
      var p = 5 
    end 
    test x+z+p==16
  end 
end
```
evaluates to stdout
```
Test Environment: 	first test environement

  testset:		my first testset
  1/1 tests passed

  testset:		my second testset
  1/1 tests passed
```
Both testsets reuse the lua and terra variables `z` and `x` defined in the beginning. In addition, the testsets have variables `y` and `p`, respectively, that can only be used inside the testset where they are defined.

### parameterized tests
It is also possible to parameterize tests. Check out the following `Vector` class and parameterized testsets
```
SVector = terralib.memoize(function(T,N)
    local struct Vector{
        _data : T[N]
    }  
    local Class = {}
    Class.Vector = Vector
 
    terra Vector:size() : int
        return N 
    end
       
    Vector.metamethods.__apply = macro(function(self,idx)
        return `self._data[idx]
    end)
       
    terra Class.fill(a : T) : Vector
        var v : Vector
        for i = 0,N do
            v(i) = a
        end
        return v
    end
    return Class
end)

import "terratest" -- using the terra unit test library
       
testenv "Vector implementation" do
  
for _,T in pairs{int32,int64} do
  for N=2,3 do  

    --parameterized testset      
    testset(N,T) "fill" do
      local SVec = SVector(T,N)                      
      terracode                              
        var y = SVec.fill(3)
      end
      test y:size()==N
      for i=0,N-1 do          
        test y(i)==T(3)
      end
    end

  end
end

end --testenv
```
which prints out the following test results
```
Test Environment: 	Vector implementation

  testset:		fill(N=2,T=int32)
  3/3 tests passed

  testset:		fill(N=3,T=int32)
  4/4 tests passed

  testset:		fill(N=2,T=int64)
  3/3 tests passed

  testset:		fill(N=3,T=int64)
  4/4 tests passed
```
Alternatively we can parameterize the `testenv` as follows
```
for _,T in pairs{int32,int64} do
  for N=2,3 do          
       
    --parameterized testenv        
    testenv(N,T) "Vector implementation" do
  
      --parameterized testset          
      testset "fill" do
        local SVec = SVector(T,N)                          
        terracode                                  
          var y = SVec.fill(3)
        end 
        test y:size()==N
        for i=0,N-1 do              
          test y(i)==T(3)
        end 
      end 
  
    end --testenv

  end --N
end --T
```
which prints out the results as follows:
```
Test Environment: 	Vector implementation(N=2,T=int32)

  testset:		fill
  3/3 tests passed

  inline tests

Test Environment: 	Vector implementation(N=3,T=int32)

  testset:		fill
  4/4 tests passed

  inline tests

Test Environment: 	Vector implementation(N=2,T=int64)

  testset:		fill
  3/3 tests passed

  inline tests

Test Environment: 	Vector implementation(N=3,T=int64)

  testset:		fill
  4/4 tests passed
```

### Future extensions
I plan the following extensions:
* A setup and teardown environment within the test environment that can be used to allocate and free heap variables.
* Better / additional test statistics.
